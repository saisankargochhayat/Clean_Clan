## Clean_Clan Web App

* A web app that gamifies the idea of “Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan” and aims to bring a change in the way we conceive it.
* People lack motivation towards the idea of doing the work themselves even if they are facing problems because of dirty surroundings.
* Adding gamification and competitiveness to this initiative can motivate more people to work and contribute to make a cleaner and safer India
